rotor optimization for 0.5 m/s
Assuming a max rotor diameter of 1.5 m/s including the hub... this will not be easy, considering the velocity term in the power term is cubic... so 1/2 m/s means we divide the power at 1 m/s by 8... yes 1/8th the output. And, did I forget to mention that it is supposed to be attached to a boat with a max payload of 350 lbs, and with other components accounted for, this system has a max weight limit of 140 lbs... so not much capture area to speak of. Super cool.
